Release v0.1
===================

This is the initial release of the technetium programming language! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Since there's no changelog to speak of, instead these release notes will serve as an introduction to technetium.

Technetium is an interpreted scripting language, which is suited for short utility scripts packaged with code (build and install scripts, for example).
