This is a rough todo list of features I need to add to the language:

* boolean literals (true, false)
* slices
* (+) for lists
* generators
* multi-file programs (import from another file)
* standard library: get command line args
* work on documentation
* make it easy to round floats when printing (I might want to write my own dtoa that is better)
* defer block
* benchmarks
