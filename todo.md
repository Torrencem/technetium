This is a rough todo list of features I need to add to the language:

* type conversion function "char"
* "escape" function based on https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html#method.escape_default
* slices
* (+) for lists, strings
* generators
* run clippy
* multi-file programs (import from another file)
* make windows use cmd.exe instead of sh
* standard library: get command line args
* work on documentation
* make it easy to round floats when printing (I might want to write my own dtoa that is better)
* defer block
* benchmarks
