This is a rough todo list of features I need to add to the language:

* split standard into more files
* replace weak\_debug with a vec of debug spans
* negative indexing a la python (check [::-1])
* generators
* pass variables as reference? (for swap)
* run clippy
* multi-file programs (import from another file)
* make windows use cmd.exe instead of sh
* standard library: get command line args
* read string literal \u{blahblah}
* work on documentation
* make it easy to round floats when printing (I might want to write my own dtoa that is better)
* defer block
* benchmarks
