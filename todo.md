This is a rough todo list of features I need to add to the language:

* format string instruction
* `$` literals (shell literal statements on their own line)
* `$` expressions (shell objects with methods and attributes)
* mutable strings
* generators
* multi-file programs (import from another file)
* standard library math (sin, cos, etc.)
* work on documentation
* benchmarks
* slices
* (+) for lists
* defer block
