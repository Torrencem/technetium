This is a rough todo list of features I need to add to the language:

* make it easy to round floats when printing
* mutable strings (should dup from constants, i.e. worry about "changing" GCD's)
* generators
* multi-file programs (import from another file)
* standard library: get command line args
* work on documentation
* slices
* (+) for lists
* defer block
* benchmarks
