This is a rough todo list of features I need to add to the language:

* short circuiting (doesn't work because arguments are evaluated before being sent into function 'or')
* run a formatter and clippy
* `type`, `to_string`, and `copy` functions
* slices
* examples in README.md
* (+) for lists
* generators
* multi-file programs (import from another file)
* standard library: get command line args
* work on documentation
* make it easy to round floats when printing (I might want to write my own dtoa that is better)
* defer block
* benchmarks
